# django-form
A repository to understand the fundamentals of Django Forms

# Explanation
I built a simple contact form where Django is saving the form data automatically into the MySQL database. It's for me an exercise to understand the fundamentals of Django forms better. 

# Prerequisites
`Python 3.10.5 and Django==4.1 or an higher version`

# Installation
Download all the Python packages that are listed in requirements.txt, add your database login credintials in the settings.py file and start the project using `python manage.py runserver`.
